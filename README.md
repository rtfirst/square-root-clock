# Real-Time Square Root Clock Visualization

This project visualizes a unique clock in real-time using `matplotlib` and `numpy`. The clock displays the hours as square roots of their squares and updates every second. It provides a fun exploration of what can be achieved with data visualization libraries in Python.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `matplotlib`: Used for visualizing the clock.
- `numpy`: Used for mathematical computations.
- `datetime`: Built-in Python library used to get the current time.
- `IPython.display`: Provides utilities to update the display in Jupyter Notebooks.

You can install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
